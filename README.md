# Roundcube Skins
Latest RC Version: 1.4.1

I have taken Larry skin and modified it so there are 10 themes to choose from so far. Larry Skin has the best layout of all other themes in my opinion, so why reinvent the wheel when all I want is a wider color choice.

I have also included skins for many popular plugins, and the ones I use, so you shouldn't have to make your own. If you need help with a plugin not available with this, please message me and ask. I just might can help you out ... 

Skins for Plugins included:
-------
account_details\
acl\
advanced_search\
archive\
authres_status\
calendar\
carddav\
chbox\
contextmenu\
converse\
enigma\
folder_info\
help\
hide_blockquote\
jqueryui\
keyboard_shortcuts\
managesieve\
markasjunk2\
message_highlight\
nextcloud\
sauserprefs\
tasklist\
vcard_attachments\
zipdownload

The Larry Skin from Roundcube 1.3 was used, so you must be running RC 1.3 or higher.

Keep coming back often as I have plans on at least 18 total skins.

Installation is easy. Upload plugins and skins folders to your roundcube installation root and it should copy to all appropriate file locations ... 

Note: Current Commit should be a working version of my ongoing nitpicking of some small color changes and making transparent images when necessary. Download and use with confidence.

Latest Update makes skins compatible with Roundcube 1.4 ...


Enjoy!
